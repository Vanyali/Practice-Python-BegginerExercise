# Practice-Python-BegginerExercise

This is was one of my first pratice exercise that i done following this site:

##  https://www.practicepython.org/


Some exercises need some polish. 
I am still learning object oriented programming, some games like tictactoe was not done by me but was copy from internet i didn't save by who, but was
in order to study how it works, i am sorry for that. In TicTacToe are different ways how to do it, some i modify some not, some are more complex than other 
and need to get more in dept to understand how it works.


I tried to follow linear as show in site. But sometimes i skip it or did some tries to solve the exercise or did multiple versions of the same problem with different ways or just copy a code from internet that was way better than mine to test and study it like TicTacToeOOP examples.
