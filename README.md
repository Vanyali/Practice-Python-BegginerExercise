##  https://www.practicepython.org/


Some exercises need some polish. 
I am still learning object oriented programming, some games like tictactoe was not done by me but was copy from internet i didn't save by who, but was
in order to study how it works, i am sorry for that. In TicTacToe are different ways how to do it, some i modify some not, some are more complex than other 
and need to get more in dept to understand how it works.
